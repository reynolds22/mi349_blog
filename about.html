        <p>My Mission with this blog is to spread information about some of the amazing dogs and cat breeds, as well as to get a good grade on this assignment. With this I am a dog owner myself and have been since I was younger. Along with my goal to get a good grade, some of my other goals being to pass this MI 349 class all together and rather than getting a A my goal here would be to extract and soak up as much information as possible. After this class and after I graduate I aspire to get a job as a full stack engineer.</p>
